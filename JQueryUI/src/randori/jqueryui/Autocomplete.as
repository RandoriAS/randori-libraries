	/**
	 * Autocomplete enables users to quickly find and select from a pre-populated list of values as they type, leveraging searching and filtering.
	 * <p>By giving an Autocomplete field focus or entering something into it, the plugin starts searching for entries that match and displays a list of values to choose from. By entering more characters, the user can filter down the list to better matches.</p><p>This can be used to choose previously selected values, such as entering tags for articles or entering email addresses from an address book. Autocomplete can also be used to populate associated information, such as entering a city name and getting the zip code.</p><p>You can pull data in from a local or remote source: Local is good for small data sets, e.g., an address book with 50 entries; remote is necessary for big data sets, such as a database with hundreds or millions of entries to select from. To find out more about customizing the data source, see the documentation for the <a href="#option-source"><code>source</code></a> option.</p><h3>Keyboard interaction</h3><p>When the menu is open, the following key commands are available:</p><ul><li>UP - Move focus to the previous item. If on first item, move focus to the input. If on the input, move focus to last item.</li><li>DOWN - Move focus to the next item. If on last item, move focus to the input. If on the input, move focus to the first item.</li><li>ESCAPE - Close the menu.</li><li>ENTER - Select the currently focused item and close the menu.</li><li>TAB - Select the currently focused item, close the menu, and move focus to the next focusable element.</li><li>PAGE UP/DOWN - Scroll through a page of items (based on height of menu). <em>It's generally a bad idea to display so many items that users need to page.</em>.</li></ul><p>When the menu is closed, the following key commands are available:</p><ul><li>UP/DOWN - Open the menu, if the <a href="#option-minLength"><code>minLength</code></a> has been met.</li></ul><h3>Dependencies</h3><ul><li><a href="/category/ui-core/">UI Core</a></li><li><a href="/jQuery.widget/">Widget Factory</a></li><li><a href="/position/">Position</a></li><li><a href="/menu/">Menu</a></li></ul>

For example, if the user enters <code>"new yo"</code> in a city field, the Autocomplete term will equal <code>"new yo"</code>.</li><li>A <code>response</code> callback, which expects a single argument: the data to suggest to the user. This data should be filtered based on the provided term, and can be in any of the formats described above for simple local data. It's important when providing a custom source callback to handle errors during the request. You must always call the <code>response</code> callback even if you encounter an error. This ensures that the widget always has the correct state.</li></ul><p>When filtering data locally, you can make use of the built-in <code>$.ui.autocomplete.escapeRegex</code> function. It'll take a single string argument and escape all regex characters, making the result safe to pass to <code>new RegExp()</code>.</p>
