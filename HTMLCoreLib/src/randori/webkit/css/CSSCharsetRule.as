/**
 *  <p>
 *  The <code>CSSCharsetRule</code> interface represents a @charset
 *  rule in a CSS style sheet. The value of the
 *  <code>encoding</code> attribute does not affect the encoding of
 *  text data in the DOM objects; this encoding is always UTF-16. After a
 *  stylesheet is loaded, the value of the <code>encoding</code> attribute is
 *  the value found in the <code>@charset</code> rule. If there was no
 *  <code>@charset</code> in the original document, then no
 *  <code>CSSCharsetRule</code> is created.  The value of the
 *  <code>encoding</code> attribute may also be used as a hint for the
 *  encoding used on serialization of the style sheet.
 *  </p><p>
 *  The value of the @charset
 *  rule (and therefore of the <code>CSSCharsetRule</code>) may
 *  not correspond to the encoding the document actually came in; character
 *  encoding information e.g. in an HTTP header, has priority (see CSS document representation) but this is
 *  not reflected in the <code>CSSCharsetRule</code>.
