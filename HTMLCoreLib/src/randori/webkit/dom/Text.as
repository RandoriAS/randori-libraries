/**
 *  <p>The <code>Text</code> interface inherits from <code>CharacterData</code> and represents the textual content (termed
 *  character data in XML) of an <code>Element</code> or <code>Attr</code>. If there is no markup inside an element's content, the text is
 *  contained in a single object implementing the <code>Text</code> interface that is the only child of the element. If there is markup, it
 *  is parsed into the information items
 *  (elements, comments, etc.) and <code>Text</code> nodes that form the list of children of the element.</p><p>When a document is first made available via the DOM, there is only one <code>Text</code> node for each block of text. Users may create adjacent <code>Text</code> nodes that represent the contents of a given element without any
 *  intervening markup, but should be aware that there is no way to represent the
 *  separations between these nodes in XML or HTML, so they will not (in general)
 *  persist between DOM editing sessions. The <code>normalize()</code> method on <code>Node</code> merges any such adjacent <code>Text</code> objects into a single node for each block of text.</p>
